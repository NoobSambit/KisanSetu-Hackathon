# Slide 2: The Problem We're Solving

## 146 Million Indian Farmers Face Critical Challenges

---

### Problem #1: Generic, One-Size-Fits-All Advice
- **Current Solutions:** Static databases, generic chatbots, blanket recommendations
- **Reality:** "Your soil is loamy, plant wheat" - But YOUR specific 2-acre plot in Punjab with your irrigation history needs DIFFERENT advice
- **Impact:** Farmers waste ₹15,000-50,000/year on wrong crops, wrong timing, wrong inputs

### Problem #2: Invisible Financial Support
- **Current State:** 500+ government schemes exist, but farmers discover only 2-3 through word-of-mouth
- **Reality:** Farmer eligible for PM Fasal Bima Yojana never knows it exists
- **Impact:** ₹1.5 lakh crore in unclaimed benefits annually (govt data)

### Problem #3: Reactive Crisis Management
- **Current Approach:** Wait for disease to spread, then treat it
- **Reality:** By the time blight is visible, 30% yield already lost
- **Impact:** ₹65,000 crore annual crop loss to preventable diseases

### Problem #4: Information Accessibility Gap
- **Current Barriers:** English-only apps, text-heavy interfaces, requires smartphone literacy
- **Reality:** 400M+ farmers use WhatsApp but can't access agri-tech
- **Impact:** Digital divide excludes smallholder farmers from AI benefits

**Our Insight:** Farmers don't need MORE information. They need information that UNDERSTANDS THEIR SPECIFIC CONTEXT.
