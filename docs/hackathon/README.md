# Hackathon Workspace Docs

This folder keeps planning and execution artifacts out of the code root while preserving daywise tracking.

## Core Planning
- `HACKATHON_PLAN.md`
- `BUSINESS_MODEL.md`
- `DIAGRAM_PROMPTS.md`
- `PRESENTATION_SLIDES_CONTENT.md`

## Daywise Tracking (Do Not Delete)
- `DAY1_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `DAY1_PROGRESS_LOG.md`
- `DAY2_PROGRESS_LOG.md`
- `DAY3_PROGRESS_LOG.md`
- `DAY4_PROGRESS_LOG.md`
- `DAY6_PROGRESS_LOG.md`

## Notes
- Daywise files are intentionally kept here for execution tracking and judging prep.
- Active delivery workflow now lives in `docs/prd/`.
- App-wide change tracking moved to `docs/prd/APPLICATION_WIDE_UPDATES.md`.
- Archived draft/presentation text files are in `docs/archive/presentation-drafts/`.
