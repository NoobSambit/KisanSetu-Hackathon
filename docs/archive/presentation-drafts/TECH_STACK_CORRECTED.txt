# 🛠️ TECH STACK - COPY PASTE TO PPT SLIDE

---

## INFRASTRUCTURE & HOSTING (Cost-Effective Approach)

Local LLM Running on Our Server (NOT farmer's device)
• Ollama runtime hosting Llama 3.2 8B model on our RTX 4050
• Single server handles 1000+ concurrent queries
• API serves responses to farmers via WhatsApp/Web interface
• Benefit: 90% cost savings vs cloud GPUs ($0 vs $0.02 per query)

Scalable Architecture
• Start with 1 RTX 4050 server for first 100K users
• Scale by adding more RTX 4050 servers (each ~₹8,000/month rental)
• Alternative: Upgrade to A100/H100 cloud GPUs only when needed for peak loads
• Hybrid approach keeps operational costs minimal

Cloud Backup for Reliability
• Vercel for frontend hosting (Free tier sufficient)
• Firebase for database (Free Spark tier: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day)
• Cloud AI (Gemini) as fallback if local server is overloaded
• Ensures 99.9% uptime

Infrastructure Costs
• Local RTX 4050 server rental: ~₹8,000/month
• Vercel hosting: ₹0 (Free tier)
• Firebase database: ₹0 (Free Spark tier)
• Total infrastructure: ₹8,000/month vs cloud-only solution: ₹2-5 lakh/month
• This enables free + affordable premium pricing
