  - `docs/application/overview/PRODUCT_DEFINITION.md`
  - `docs/application/overview/SCOPE_BASELINE.md`
- Architecture and modules:
  - `docs/application/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`
  - `docs/application/architecture/APPLICATION_MODULES.md`
- Data and API:
  - `docs/application/data/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/application/api/API_INVENTORY.md`
- Runtime and operations:
  - `docs/application/operations/SECURITY_PRIVACY_COMPLIANCE.md`
  - `docs/application/operations/ENVIRONMENT_RUNTIME_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  - `docs/application/operations/QUALITY_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
  - `docs/application/operations/RELEASE_READINESS.md`
- Governance and change history:
  - `docs/application/governance/DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE.md`
  - `docs/application/CHANGELOG.md`

## Notes
