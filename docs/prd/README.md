# Daywise PRD System

This folder is the source of truth for planning, execution tracking, and delivery quality across the hackathon.

## Primary Files
- `PRD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`: current status by day and phase
- `APPLICATION_WIDE_UPDATES.md`: cross-cutting changes across the app
- `DAY_01_CORE_PERSONALIZATION_PRD.md`
- `DAY_02_POLICY_MATCHER_SATELLITE_SETUP_PRD.md`
- `DAY_03_SATELLITE_VOICE_ASSISTANT_PRD.md`
- `DAY_04_PREDICTIVE_AI_COMMUNITY_PRD.md`
- `DAY_05_WHATSAPP_DOCUMENTS_WEATHER_PRD.md`
- `DAY_06_INTEGRATION_DASHBOARD_DEMO_PRD.md`

## Operating Model
- Start each task by reading `PRD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`.
- Select the in-progress or next pending phase from the relevant day PRD.
- Execute work.
- Update:
  - the day-phase status in `PRD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
  - `APPLICATION_WIDE_UPDATES.md`
  - technical docs in the relevant modules under `docs/application/` (start at `docs/application/README.md`)

## Constraint Guardrail
- Free services and open-source tooling only.
- No paid APIs should be introduced unless explicitly approved by project owner.
